# Neural-Networks
This repository contains the jupyter notebook for various neural networks developed from scratch which can be used for learning purposes if you're a beginner.
Codes in this repository can give you a basic intuition of how the Neural Networks are trained and tested. Some basic bitwise functions are implemented using neural networks for better understanding of the concepts
